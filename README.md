## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good refresher project helping me solidify what I've been learning on HTML and CSS while getting familiar with JavaScript basics.

### Continued development

I did this project while learning the JavaScript basics. Javascript is not going down as easy as HTML and CSS but it must work!


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand how to use various css rules and how important they are. 
- (https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing website which has really old questions but are still relevant to people like me today who seem to have joined this bandwagon very late. It's nice and helpful they've been around for so long.
